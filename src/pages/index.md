    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Bangladesh's economy has grown roughly 6% per year since 2005 despite
    prolonged periods of political instability, poor infrastructure, endemic
    corruption, insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic
    reforms. Although more than half of GDP is generated through the services
    sector, almost half of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector,
    with rice as the single-most-important product. Garments, the backbone of
    Bangladesh's industrial sector, accounted for more than 80% of total exports
    in FY 2016-17. The industrial sector continues to grow, despite the need for
    improvements in factory safety conditions. Steady export growth in the
    garment sector, combined with $13 billion in remittances from overseas
    Bangladeshis, contributed to Bangladesh's rising foreign exchange reserves
    in FY 2016-17. The recent influx of over 700,000 additional refugees from
    Burma will place pressure on the Bangladeshi government’s budget and the
    country’s rice supplies, which declined in 2017 in part because of record
    flooding. Recent improvements to energy infrastructure, including the start
    of liquefied natural gas imports in 2018, represent a major step forward in
    resolving a key growth bottleneck.
